=head1 DESCRIPTION

A simple testing tool, with only pure Perl dependancies, that checks if
two XML documents are "the same".  In particular this module will check if
the documents schemantically equal as defined by the XML 1.0 specification
(i.e. that the two documents would construct the same DOM
model when parsed, so things like character sets and if you've used two tags
or a self closing tags aren't important.)

This modules is a strict superset of B<Test::XML>'s interface meaning if you
were using that module to check if two identical documents were the same then
this module should function as a drop in replacement.  Be warned, however,
that this module by default is a lot stricter about how the XML documents
are allowed to differ.

=head2 Functions

This module, by default, exports a number of functions into your namespace.

=over

=item is_xml($xml_to_test, $expected_xml, $options_hashref)

Tests that the passed XML is "the same" as the expected XML.

XML can be passed into this function in one of two ways;  Either you can
provide a string (which the function will parse for you) or you can pass in
an B<XML::Easy::Element> that you've constructed yourself somehow.

This funtion takes several options as the third argument.  These can be
passed in as a hashref:

=over

=item description

The name of the test that will be used in constructing the C<ok> / C<not ok>
test output.

=item ignore_whitespace

Ignore many whitespace differences in text nodes.  Currently
this has the same effect as turning on C<ignore_surrounding_whitespace>
and C<ignore_different_whitespace>.

=item ignore_surrounding_whitespace

Ignore differences in leading and trailing whitespace
between elements.  This means that

  <p>foo bar baz</p>

Is considered the same as

  <p>
    foo bar baz
  </p>

And even

  <p>
    this is my cat:<img src="http://myfo.to/KsSc.jpg" />
  </p>

Is considered the same as:

  <p>
    this is my cat: <img src="http://myfo.to/KsSc.jpg" />
  </p>

Even though, to a web-browser, that extra space is significant whitespace
and the two documents would be renderd differently.

However, as comments are completely ignored (we treat them as if they were
never even in the document) the following:

  <p>foo<!-- a comment -->bar</p>

would be considered different to

  <p>
    foo
    <!-- a comment -->
    bar
  </p>

As it's the same as comparing the string

  "foobar"

And:

    "foo
    
    bar"

The same is true for processing instructions and DTD declarations.

=item ignore_leading_whitespace

The same as C<ignore_surrounding_whitespace> but only ignore
the whitespace immediately after an element node not
immedately before.

=item ignore_trailing_whitespace

The same as C<ignore_surrounding_whitespace> but only ignore
the whitespace immediately before an element node not
immedately after.

=item ignore_different_whitespace

If set to a true value ignores differences in what characters
make up whitespace in text nodes.  In other words, this option
makes the comparison only care that wherever there's whitespace
in the expected XML there's any whitespace in the actual XML
at all, not what that whitespace is made up of.

It means the following

  <p>
    foo bar baz
  </p>

Is the same as

  <p>
    foo
    bar
    baz
  </p>

But not the same as

  <p>
    foobarbaz
  </p>

This setting has no effect on attribute comparisons.

=item verbose

If true, print obsessive amounts of debug info out while
checking things

=back

If a third argument is passed to this function and that argument
is not a hashref then it will be assumed that this argument is
the the description as passed above.  i.e.

  is_xml $xml, $expected, "my test";

is the same as

  is_xml $xml, $expected, { description => "my test" };

=item isnt_xml($xml_to_test, $not_expected_xml, $options_hashref)

Exactly the same as C<is_xml> (taking exactly the same options) but passes
if and only if what is passed is different to the not expected XML.

By different, of course, we mean schematically different according to the
XML 1.0 specification.  For example, this will fail:

  isnt_xml "<foo/>", "<foo></foo>";

as those are schematically the same XML documents.

However, it's worth noting that the first argument doesn't even have to be
valid XML for the test to pass.  Both these pass as they're not schemantically
identical to the not expected XML:

  isnt_xml undef, $not_expecteded_xml;
  isnt_xml "<foo>", $not_expected_xml;

as invalid XML is not ever schemanitcally identical to a valid XML document.

If you want to insist what you pass in is valid XML, but just not the
same as the other xml document you pass in then you can use two tests:

  is_well_formed_xml $xml;
  isnt_xml $xml, $not_expected_xml;

This function accepts the C<verbose> option (just as C<is_xml> does) but
turning it on doesn't actually output anything extra - there's not useful this
function can output that would help you diagnose the failure case.

=head2 A note on Character Handling

If you do not pass it an XML::Easy::Element object then these functions will happly parse
XML from the characters contained in whatever scalars you passed in.  They will not
(and cannot) correctly parse data from a scalar that contains binary data (e.g. that
you've sucked in from a raw file handle) as they would have no idea what characters
those octlets would represent

As long as your XML document contains legal characters from the ASCII range (i.e.
chr(1) to chr(127)) this distintion will not matter to you.

However, if you use characters above codepoint 127 then you will probably need to
convert any bytes you have read in into characters.  This is usually done by using
C<Encode::decode>, or by using a PerlIO layer on the filehandle as you read the data
in.

If you don't know what any of this means I suggest you read the Encode::encode manpage
very carefully.  Tom Insam's slides at L<http://jerakeen.org/talks/perl-loves-utf8/>
may or may not help you understand this more (they at the very least contain a
cheatsheet for conversion.)

The author highly recommends those of you using latin-1 characters from a utf-8 source
to use B<Test::utf8> to check the string for common mistakes before handing it C<is_xml>.

=head1 BUGS

There's a few cavets when using this module:

=over

=item Not a validating parser

Infact, we don't process (or compare) DTDs at all.  These nodes are completely
ignored (it's as if you didn't include them in the string at all.)

=item Comments and processing instructions are ignored

We totally ignore comments and processing instructions, and it's as
if you didn't include them in the string at all either.

=item Limited entity handling

We only support the five "core" named entities (i.e. C<&amp;>,
C<&lt;>, C<&gt;>, C<&apos;> and C<&quot;>) and numerical entities
(in decimal or hex form.)  It is not possible to declare further named
entities and the precence of undeclared named entities will either cause
an exception to be thrown (in the case of the expected string) or the test to
fail (in the case of the string you are testing)

=item No namespace support

Currently this is only an XML 1.0 parser, and not XML Namespaces aware (further
options may be added to later version of this module to enable namespace support)

This means the following document:

  <foo:fred xmlns:foo="http://www.twoshortplanks.com/namespaces/test/fred" />

Is considered to be different to

  <bar:fred xmlns:bar="http://www.twoshortplanks.com/namespaces/test/fred" />

=item Perlish whitespace handling

This module considers "whitespace" to be whatever matches a \s* in a
regular expression.  This is not strictly identical to what the XML
specification considers to be whitespace.

=item No node reordering support

Unlike B<Test::XML> this module considers the order of sibling nodes to be
significant, and you cannot tell it to ignore the differring order of nodes
when comparing the expected and actual output.
